        Performs speech recognition on ``audio_data`` (an ``AudioData`` instance), using the Google Speech Recognition API.

        The Google Speech Recognition API key is specified by ``key``. If not specified, it uses a generic key that works out of the box. This should generally be used for personal or testing purposes only, as it **may be revoked by Google at any time**.

        To obtain your own API key, simply following the steps on the `API Keys <http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys>`__ page at the Chromium Developers site. In the Google Developers Console, Google Speech Recognition is listed as "Speech API".

        The recognition language is determined by ``language``, an RFC5646 language tag like ``"en-US"`` (US English) or ``"fr-FR"`` (International French), defaulting to US English. A list of supported language tags can be found in this `StackOverflow answer <http://stackoverflow.com/a/14302134>`__.

        Returns the most likely transcription if ``show_all`` is false (the default). Otherwise, returns the raw API response as a JSON dictionary.

        Raises a ``speech_recognition.UnknownValueError`` exception if the speech is unintelligible. Raises a ``speech_recognition.RequestError`` exception if the speech recognition operation failed, if the key isn't valid, or if there is no internet connection.

        Records a single phrase from ``source`` (an ``AudioSource`` instance) into an ``AudioData`` instance, which it returns.

        This is done by waiting until the audio has an energy above ``recognizer_instance.energy_threshold`` (the user has started speaking), and then recording until it encounters ``recognizer_instance.pause_threshold`` seconds of non-speaking or there is no more audio input. The ending silence is not included.

        The ``timeout`` parameter is the maximum number of seconds that this will wait for a phrase to start before giving up and throwing an ``speech_recognition.WaitTimeoutError`` exception. If ``timeout`` is ``None``, there will be no wait timeout.

        The ``phrase_time_limit`` parameter is the maximum number of seconds that this will allow a phrase to continue before stopping and returning the part of the phrase processed before the time limit was reached. The resulting audio will be the phrase cut off at the time limit. If ``phrase_timeout`` is ``None``, there will be no phrase time limit.

        The ``snowboy_configuration`` parameter allows integration with `Snowboy <https://snowboy.kitt.ai/>`__, an offline, high-accuracy, power-efficient hotword recognition engine. When used, this function will pause until Snowboy detects a hotword, after which it will unpause. This parameter should either be ``None`` to turn off Snowboy support, or a tuple of the form ``(SNOWBOY_LOCATION, LIST_OF_HOT_WORD_FILES)``, where ``SNOWBOY_LOCATION`` is the path to the Snowboy root directory, and ``LIST_OF_HOT_WORD_FILES`` is a list of paths to Snowboy hotword configuration files (`*.pmdl` or `*.umdl` format).

        This operation will always complete within ``timeout + phrase_timeout`` seconds if both are numbers, either by returning the audio data, or by raising a ``speech_recognition.WaitTimeoutError`` exception.
